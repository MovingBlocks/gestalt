/**
 * Marks a {@link org.terasology.assets.format.AssetAlterationFileFormat AssetAlterationFileFormat} to be automatically registered by
 * {@link ModuleAwareAssetTypeManager ModuleAwareAssetTypeManager} on environment change to handle asset supplemental data files.
 * Supplemental data files are common across multiple file formats. For example, textures may support both '.png' and '.bmp' files (with one AssetFormat for each),
 * but also support secondary '.info' file that provides additional information such as the runtime compression or clamping technique to use. Supplemental file formats
 * support this use case.
 * <p>
 * Supplemental file formats are used both for loading standard asset and overrides.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default the AssetAlterationFormat must have an empty constructor, or one taking an AssetManager
