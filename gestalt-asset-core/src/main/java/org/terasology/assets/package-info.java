/**
 * This package provides an Asset System - a way of creating, loading and managing assets. An asset is a shared resource that can be resolved by a uri or partial uri. For a
 * game, some potential assets are sounds, textures, and object definitions.
 * <p>
 * The main classes of the asset system are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>AssetType, a manager for a type of Asset</li>
 * <li>Asset, a fully loaded asset. This should be subclassed for each type of asset</li>
 * <li>ResourceUrn, the identifier for an asset</li>
 * <li>AssetData, an implementation independent representation of an asset. This should be subclassed for each type of asset</li>
 * <li>AssetDataProducer, a provider of AssetData</li>
 * <li>AssetFactory, that converts an AssetData into  full blown Asset</li>
 * </ul>
