/**
 * A component is an element that can be added to an entity. A component holds data, and implies a feature or behavior of the entity.
 * <p>
 * All components should be concrete final objects implementing component and its methods, and having both an empty constructor and a copy method as a minimum.
 * If a copy constructor is available it will be used too.
 * <p>
 * In general Component implementations should be final and not inherit other Component implementations. Entity Systems are a composition based approach -
 * the behaviour of an entity is determined by its components. If there is shared behavior between components instead the shared element can be pulled apart to
 * produce a separate component that works in tandem with the components it was extracted from.
