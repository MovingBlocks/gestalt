/**
 * A reference to an entity recipe, for use by components within a prefab. When the prefab containing the EntityRecipeRef is instantiated, the EntityRecipeRef will be replaced with a reference to the now instantiated entity from the prefab.
 * This allows a prefab to be a structure of entities that reference each other.
 * It otherwise behaves as a NullEntityRef (in the situation it somehow leaks into a live entity system)
 * Note: Doesn't inherit NullEntityRef because that would result in broken equals behavior.
