/**
 * Marks an event as synchronous - to run immediately when sent, rather than being queued to run later.
 * Note: Care should be taken around the use of synchronous events, as components the caller has loaded are
 * not visible to the handlers of the synchronous event - if the handlers modify a component the caller
 * has loaded then the caller won't see those changes unless it reloads the component (and may save
 * over those changes). Recommendation is the caller commits any changes that may be relevant before
 * sending a synchronous event, and that the receivers do not modify anything
